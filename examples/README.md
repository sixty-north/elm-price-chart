# Basic example

This demonstrates how to use `PriceChart`. The easiest way to view the demo is
with [`elm-live`](https://github.com/tomekwi/elm-live). Once you have that
installed, run it like this:

```
elm-live Basic.elm --output=elm.js --open
```

If everything works, this will open up a browser window with a price chart
showing come canned data.
